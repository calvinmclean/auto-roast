- [ ] Create CLI to do serial input/output and store to a log. Easier than opening up Arduino IDE. Bubbletea would be nice, but probably not worth the effort
- [ ] Parse file with serial commands + sleep/delay and send to the device to automate roasting. This will have to be started after pre-heat or include a pause to load beans and resume
- [ ] Automate conversion of roast logs into list of commands to re-produce
- [ ] Create TestCommand ('Z') to run a few cycles of clicks and turns to make sure machine is set up correctly. Accept args for different test routines (at least one before 'Start' and one after)
